Approved or Denied?

A permanent labor certification issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) allows an employer to hire a foreign worker to work permanently in the United States. In this study we will explore how likely USCIS will approve or deny visa application. This is a visa decision prediction based on employee's job history, education, job title, employer, class of admission and many other factors. 

The dataset to be use in this study is us_perm_visas.csv from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/us-perm-visas). This data was collected and distributed by the [US Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent).
